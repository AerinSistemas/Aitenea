    This node evaluates the acquired dataset. 
    <hr>
    The output of this node is a json format and it is structured by two parts:

    <h1 style="color:black;"><b>1. Origin</b></h1>
    <p>It has the origin of the data such as csv, txt, json, elastic (If the data comes from <i>Elasticsearch</i>), among others.<br>
      Also, it contains the name of the index that previously were declared in the prior node. 
      Finally, it shows the columns name that were splitted in the X and Y attributes.    
    </p>

    <h2 style = "color:black"><b>2. Evaluation</b></h2>
    <p>The evaluation part indicates the number of entries (rows) that are present on the data to be evaluated. <br>
      Aside from that, it shows several items that are explained as follows: <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>data type X:</i></b> It shows the data type for each attribute that has defined as X attribute.</li>
        <li><b><i>data describe X:</i></b> t shows the number of entries, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value, and the percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%).
           This statistical information is shown for each attribute that has defined as X attribute.</li>
        <li><b><i>data type Y:</i></b> It shows the data type for each attribute that has defined as Y attribute.</li>
        <li><b><i>data describe Y:</i></b> It shows the number of entries, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value, and the percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%).
          This statistical information is shown for each attribute that has defined as Y attribute.</li>
        <li><b><i>correlation:</i></b> It shows the relationship between attributes.</li>
      </ul>
